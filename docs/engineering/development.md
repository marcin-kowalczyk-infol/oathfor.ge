# Development guide

Status: API kernel and checks scaffolded; mobile and service integration are pending.

## Available now

Requirements: Git and Python 3.11+. See [commands](../../.agents/commands/README.md).

```sh
python3 .agents/commands/check_repository.py
git diff --check
mkdir -p graphics
```

The checker reads tracked/untracked non-ignored project files, resolves local Markdown file links, validates shared skills/role registration, and checks ignore behavior. It does not contact providers or prove application correctness.

## Application setup — pending

When scaffolding is requested:
- Select compatible supported Expo/React Native/Node versions from official documentation; record the versions and commit the chosen lockfile. No Expo SDK version is fixed by the previous chat. **Basis: [Expo monorepos](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/monorepos/); lockfile policy is local.**
- Create Symfony 7.4 LTS under `apps/api` using its normal structure; document PHP/extensions and commit Composer's lockfile. **Basis: [Symfony practices](https://symfony.com/doc/7.4/best_practices.html); version choice: [ADR 0001](../decisions/0001-project-foundation.md).**
- Replace this pending section with commands verified against actual manifests for install, run, test, lint, type/static analysis and migrations. **Local workflow.**
- Document configuration names in reviewed example files with placeholders. Do not put private tokens in examples, mobile variables or logs. **Basis: [security rules](../../.agents/rules/security.md).**

## API — Symfony 7.4 kernel

Local tooling selection, 2026-09-23: PHP 8.5.x CLI and Composer 2.x. Verified host: PHP 8.5.7, Composer 2.10.1. Locked dependencies include FrameworkBundle 7.4.19, PHPUnit 12.5.35 and PHPStan 2.2.15. Symfony components stay constrained to `7.4.*`; exact versions live in `apps/api/composer.lock` and Flex recipes in `symfony.lock`.

Runtime prerequisites: Ctype, iconv, PCRE, Session, SimpleXML and Tokenizer for [Symfony 7.4](https://symfony.com/doc/7.4/setup.html); DOM, JSON, libxml, mbstring, XML and XMLWriter for [PHPUnit 12.5](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/12.5/installation.html). PHP 8.5 satisfies Symfony's PHP 8.2+ and PHPUnit's PHP 8.3+ floors. [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/getting-started) requires PHP 7.4+; [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) requires PHP 7.2.5+. Sources checked 2026-09-23. Required extensions were present in `php -m`; coverage drivers are optional and not installed.

On a new macOS machine, use the [PHP macOS package instructions](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.macosx.packages.php) to install PHP 8.5, then Composer's linked installer instructions with its current checksum verification. Check `php --version`, `php -m` and `composer --version` before installing this project.

From the repository root, on a fresh checkout:

```sh
cd apps/api
cp .env.example .env
composer install --no-interaction
composer validate --strict
composer check-platform-reqs
php bin/console about
composer test
composer analyse
```

The copy step is for a new checkout; preserve an existing `.env`. The example contains an explicitly `DUMMY` local secret, not production credentials. Tests use a separate inert test secret. No database, queue or provider credentials are needed. Real environment files stay ignored. Sources: [Symfony setup](https://symfony.com/doc/7.4/setup.html), [security rules](../../.agents/rules/security.md).

`composer test` runs PHPUnit with nonempty test discovery and a kernel boot check. `composer analyse` runs PHPStan level 8 over `src/` and `tests/`; generated caches stay ignored. The kernel harness follows [Symfony testing](https://symfony.com/doc/7.4/testing.html). The functional test verifies the public [liveness contract](api-contract.md), including its exact JSON body. Clean-checkout server verification follows in T04; database, Messenger, mobile and CI are pending.

## Troubleshooting the foundation

- Broken symlink: restore its relative target from the [agent guide](../../.agents/README.md). Do not maintain a second copy.
- Skill/role absent: restart the agent in this repository, check project trust/settings and supported version; use the documented manual fallback if the host lacks discovery.
- Missing graphics after clone: expected, because Git excludes the entire directory.
- Mobile/service commands are pending their scaffold tasks; the API commands above are available.
